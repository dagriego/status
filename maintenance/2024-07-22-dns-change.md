## Device facing DNS updates

On Tuesday, 2024-07-23 at 15:00 UTC Foundries.io team will be performing an
update to the IPv4 addresses for the device-gateway and EST services. The
current IPv4 addresses will be left running for 60 days to provide adequate
time for devices to pick up the DNS change.

The changes will be:

| Service        | Current       | New           |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| device-gateway | 35.226.43.150 | 34.171.143.59 |
| EST server     | 34.173.97.119 | 35.202.202.20 |
